            {`Public keys enable people all around the world to access secure and credible information anywhere with an internet connection. At this time of age, all the information is accessible on the internet. However, a secure connection must be established before viewing information on a website. "A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography" states that unencrypted websites are incredibly vulnerable to cyber attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks and packet sniffing. This puts the user's data, such as credit card credentials, at risk and sometimes even results in compromised devices. If users were constantly put at risk because of poor encryption ont he internet users would not rely on it as much.  In addition, websites that are not secure and do not have encryption often have vulnerabilities that can be exploited to alter the data on them. This can also be done to the user using "man in the middle" attacks, where hackers can change how the website looks to the user. This will significantly damage the credibility of even the most trustworthy website. However, the public key encryption system ensures the safety of these websites by using SSL certificates. These are signed and locked with a key that is kept secret and uncrackable. It still ensures the user can read the website, while attackers can not alter or hack websites. This could not have been possible without asymmetrical encryption, a frontier for how the general public accesses information.`}
