            Encryption is the process of encoding a message using a key to
            protect it from being read by unauthorized parties. Standard
            encryption uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt the message
            which is called symmetric encryption. However, in the case of
            public-private key encryption, one key named the public key is used
            to encrypt the message, and another key named the private key is
            used to decrypt the message. Thus, public-private key encryption.

            Mathematically, the public key can be derived from the private key
            very easily, however, the private key is much less impossible to
            derive from the public key. This makes it such that the public key
            can be shared with anyone without compromising the security of the
            private key. Once the public key gets shared, anyone can encrypt a
            message using the public key and send it to the recipient and only
            the recipient can decrypt the message using their private key.
            Clifford Cocks was the first to create a public-private key
            encryption system in 1973 at Government Communications Headquarters
            (GCHQ). However, the method that he discovered was classified until
            1977 when three researchers at the University of Southern California
            discovered it and named it RSA. They were called Ron Rivest, Adi
            Shamir, and Leonard Adleman. RSA is and continues to be one of the
            most influential inventions in today's world. It created a new
            frontier in the field of cryptography along with changing how the
            world obtains information, communicates, and protects its data. Not
            only from prying eyes but also from the government.
