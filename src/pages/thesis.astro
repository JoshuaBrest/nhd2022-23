            {`Encryption is the process of encoding a message using a key to protect it from being read by unauthorized parties. Standard encryption uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt the message which is called symmetric encryption. However, in the case of public-private key encryption, one key named the public key is used to encrypt the message, and another key named the private key is used to decrypt the message. Thus, public-private key encryption.`}

            {`Mathematically, the public key can be derived from the private key very easily, however, the private key is much less impossible to derive from the public key. This makes it such that the public key can be shared with anyone without compromising the security of the private key. Once the public key gets shared, anyone can encrypt a message using the public key and send it to the recipient and only the recipient can decrypt the message using their private key. In 1918, when Enigma was invented by German engineer Arthur Scherbius, it was meant for commercial use. However, when World War II broke out, it was used by the Nazis to encrypt messages. This gave them a significant advantage in the war, as no one could crack it at that time. In 1973, Clifford Christopher Cocks, a researcher at GCHQ, invented a public-key cryptography algorithm that was kept classified. Three years later, Whitfield Diffie published a paper on public-key cryptography. In 1977, just one year later, Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman took a significant interest in Whitfield Diffie's work. developed RSA, a secure asymmetric key encryption system based on PCK. Though some people think public key encryption is a threat to the public as it allows criminals to communicate anonymously, this technology brings more benefit than harm as it is a frontier on how we communicate, access information, and protect a nation's security.`}
