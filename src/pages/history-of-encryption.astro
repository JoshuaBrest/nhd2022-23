            There are countless encryption-related historical events. One
            example is the attempted assassination of Queen Elizabeth I
            (Babington Plot). This, however, failed because of poor encryption
            on the end of the Mary I of Scotland, who got sentenced to death
            because of this. Poor encryption changed the course of history.
            addition, encryption is extremely important in wars. Military
            personnel need to be commanded, and preferably without foreign
            intelligence knowing what they are doing. One example of this was
            the German U-boats during World War II. The reason U-boats were so
            successful, was because they were unexpected, and the allies didn't
            know where the U-boats were. When it was cracked and the allies knew
            where the U-boats were, it was much, much less effective. If
            asymmetric encryption existed during these times, Queen Elizabeth I
            could have died and the Germans could have won!
