            {`Asymmetrical encryption protects the credentials of government agencies. Without this layer of security, hackers can easily impersonate government officials. They can alter information in government databases, such as a person’s records. They will have the power to frame anyone they want and ease their own crimes. They will also be able to access the most classified documents. This would be a national security risk and cause the downfall of a government. “Computer and Network Security” states that since the encryption used in the US power grid is poor, it could be easily cracked. This type of grid cyberattack once occurred in 2015 when hackers knocked out power to almost a quarter of a million people in Ukraine. This just shows how vulnerable a system is without good cybersecurity and how important encryption is. In addition, law enforcement when a crime breaks out. However, if the channel of communication is not secure, it could also be hacked. Since they can’t receive critical information that is used to apprehend criminals, the criminals are free to commit crimes. This would also be a disaster for the people, law enforcement, and the nation. So asymmetrical encryption is also critical for a nation's security and the welfare of its people.`}

            {`In addition, the 4th amendment protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. Even single American citizens are under its protection. This is especially helpful in protecting the privacy of normal citizens, as national security agencies are prevented from hacking into devices without a warrant. Even though this amendment didn’t originally cover the digital space, it does now. All due to a series of cases, where the FBI presented evidence that was obtained through illegal means, which rendered the evidence invalid to present. One famous case is the Carpenter v. United STATES case, where Carpenter and three others committed armed robbery. After one of his accomplices got caught, he gave up the phone numbers. The FBI went through CSLI records, where they found the geographic location of the men at that time.`}
