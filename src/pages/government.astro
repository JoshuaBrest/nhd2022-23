            Thirdly, asymmetrical encryption protects the credentials of
            government agencies. Without this layer of security, hackers can
            easily impersonate government officials. They can alter information
            in government databases, such as a person’s records. They will have
            the power to frame anyone they want and ease their own crimes. They
            will also be able to access the most classified documents. This
            would be a national security risk and cause the downfall of a
            government. "Computer and Network Security" states that since the
            encryption used in the US power grid is poor, it could be easily
            cracked. This type of grid cyberattack once occurred in 2015 when
            hackers knocked out power to almost a quarter of a million people in
            Ukraine. This just shows how vulnerable a system is without good
            cybersecurity and how important encryption is. In addition, law
            enforcement when a crime breaks out. However, if the channel of
            communication isn’t secure, it could also be hacked. Since they
            can’t receive critical information that is used to apprehend
            criminals, the criminals are free to commit crimes. This would also
            be a disaster for the people, law enforcement, and the nation. So
            asymmetrical encryption is also critical for a nation's security and
            the welfare of its people.
