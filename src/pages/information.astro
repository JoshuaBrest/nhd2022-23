            Public keys enable people all around the world to access secure and
            credible information anywhere with an internet connection. At this
            time of age, all the information is accessible on the internet.
            However, a secure connection must be established before viewing
            information on a website. "A Graduate Course in Applied
            Cryptography" states that unencrypted websites are incredibly
            vulnerable to cyber attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks and
            packet sniffing. This puts the user's data, such as credit card
            credentials, at risk and, in some cases, even results in compromised
            devices. No one would use the internet if there were no encryption
            strong enough to protect its users, as the users would always be at
            risk of being hacked. In addition, websites that are not secure and
            don't have encryption often have vulnerabilities that can be
            exploited to alter the data on them. This can also be done to the
            user using "man in the middle" attacks, where hackers can change how
            the website looks to the user. This will significantly damage the
            credibility of even the most trustworthy website. However, the
            public key encryption system ensures the safety of these websites by
            using SSL certificates. These are signed and locked with a key that
            is kept secret and uncrackable. It still ensures the user can read
            the website, while attackers can't alter or hack websites. This
            couldn't have been possible without asymmetrical encryption, a
            frontier for how the general public accesses information.
