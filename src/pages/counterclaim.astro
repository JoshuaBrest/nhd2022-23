            {`Though some might argue that public key encryption allows criminals to communicate and harm people without the government knowing in advance, this is not true. According to the Counterintelligence and Cyber team, criminals have increasingly used encrypted channels, like Telegram and Signal, to avoid law enforcement detection. This led to concern that public keys were too secure, not allowing law enforcement to protect citizens. This is true; however, even if the criminals aren't just using modern technology, they could still use other communication devices. Such as burner phones, landlines, and encrypted texts. Even if public key encryption did not exist, the government would still be unable to address the issue that criminals will always find a way to communicate. In addition, most of the life-threatening crimes committed aren't even planned. They are done at a moment's notice out of anger or strong emotions. So the most dangerous crimes aren't even caused by the criminals' ability to communicate online. However, if public key encryption were banned, fast and secure communication would not be possible. In addition, credible information also cannot be accessed. Either way, banning encryption would be unconstitutional. The fourth amendment states that the government can not access people's and corporations' documents without reasonable suspicion. Banning encryption or creating a backdoor prevents people from defending their data which, according to the 4th amendment, is illegal. `}
