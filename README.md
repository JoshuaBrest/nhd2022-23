# NHD Project 2022

This is my 2022 NHD project's website. This years theme is "frontiers in histroy" and my topic is on asymetrical encryption.

## Website structure

I'm using a framework called astro combined with react, typescript, and tailwind css to build this website.

## How to run

You can debug this website by using:

```sh
yarn dev
```

The deployment however, will be hosted on [NHD website builder](https://website.nhd.org/).

## How to deploy

I have github actions setup to automatically deploy to the NHD website builder. You can see the workflow file [here](.github/workflows/nhd-upload.yml).
